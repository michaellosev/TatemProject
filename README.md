# Tatem Web Dev Challenge (Front-End/Full-Stack)

```Random Chipotle Bowl Generator```

## Task: create a website that generates a random meal at Chipotle.

We love ordering food together as a team, but with so limited options at Chipotle, sometimes we need a little inspiration to spice things up!

### Requirements:

* our current frontend stack (which has been initialized in this repo)
* each order must have 1 protein, bean & rice; everything else is all up to your random generator

-----

### Notes:

This is a fairly open-ended prompt, so feel free to build **something that you enjoy / can add to your portfolio** *(this is your code not ours!)*

This assignment should take you ~2-6 hours (spread over a few days is okay)

> The goal is to see how you code in a fairly open-ended context, not to make the world's best website â€” so slam away at that keyboard and have fun!
